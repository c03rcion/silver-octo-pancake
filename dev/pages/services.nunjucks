          <h3>Industry Knowledge and Experience</h3>
          <p>
            At TCL Consulting we use our experience in the cannabis industry to develop your cannabis testing laboratory in a timely manner.  We will help avoid any of these issues and at the same time ensure your facility meets ISO 17025 (International Organization for Standardization), NELAP TNI (National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program)  and NEFAP (National Environmental Field Activities Program) accreditation standards and field sampling protocols.

          <h3>100% Client Commitment</h3>
          <p>TCLâ€™s objective is good customer service while setting up your accredited laboratory for the purpose of testing cannabis products.  Completing an accredited laboratory is a very time consuming endeavor requiring industry knowledge and experience that can take from 12 months to over 18 months to implement.  Additionally, since there is no standard methodology, everything must be created and verified from scratch and mistakes can increase that timeline considerably.</p>
